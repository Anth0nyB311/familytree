## About
Family tree is a program in which you can enter your own heritage in a sorted manner. This program has a CLI/GUI interface where you can interract in a DML style of coding. It is very simple to grasp which makes it simple for anyone to use. The main purpose of this program was to show our OOP skills in Python by using features such as polymorphism or inhertiance (which you can see in family_lib.py). We also try to maintain a high level of PEP8 where we can... I have taken inspiration for this program from my previous projects (mainly NiniteForCMD) which has the same style of interaction. 

# Getting started
1) Make sure you have the correct Python version and libraries installed with Git. Currently, the only version that works at this moment is ***Python 3.12*** (Python 3.13 does not work yet as windows-curses hasn't been updated yet).
- If you are running Windows with choco (if not, [install it](https://chocolatey.org/install)), here is how to get the correct version of python:
```bash
choco install python312 git
```
- Now, get the needed libraries (on a new CLI)
```bash
pip install pyyaml windows-curses
```
2) Now we just get our work enviroment ready and ready to run!
- Create a new directory, and then clone our repo
```bash
mkdir project
cd project
git clone https://github.com/Anth0nyB311/familytree.git
cd familytree
```
- Run the program, **IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU RUN FROM START.PY!**
```bash
python start.py
```
3) You have our program! Try using the demo to check out features!
