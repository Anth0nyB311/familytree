#### Scenario
The family would like to create a digital family tree. Cornelia Emmersohn knows that she has Indian/Asian roots whilst her husband, Otto Emmersohn, has ancestors from all over Europe. Unfortunately, not everyone has one spouse and two children. People can have more than one spouse in their lifetime (though not simultaneously). Unfortunately, children can die before their parents, which can influence who inherits.

Every person in the Emmersohn family must have parents and a name, be born, and may have died, although in a few cases not all their details may be known. A person can be related to other family members as follows: parent, partner, child, sibling, cousin, etc. The record for each person in the tree should hold the minimum information listed above. The record should not include fields for siblings, cousins, etc.

#### Requirements
- Work in pairs to implement the project, but write individual reports.
- Define custom data types for modeling a family tree in Python using Object-Oriented Design (OOP) principles.
- One member should create the data for the ancestors of Cornelia Emmersohn (maternal branch) while the other should create the data for the ancestors of Otto Emmersohn (paternal branch).
- Each member should have records for at least 10 family members, ensuring consistency in the order of information with the partner.
- Each member should populate their respective branch with the data of their members.
- The two branches should be combined into a complete family tree for the final features of the implementation.
